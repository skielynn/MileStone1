Gravity Falls Quiz : My First Game

Gravity Falls Quiz is a multiple choice quiz made with CSS JAVA & HTML, based on the Disney show Gravity Falls. Uses array concepts
as well as if/else statements. 

PROCESS :
    My first game first started off as an obstacle game. The idea was the character would move with arrow keys and collect coins, then hit the finish line. Issues arised when I noticed it would be harder to obtain than I thought. I created the map for that game, but when I realized it was not functional I decided to restart.
    My second attepmt at creating something wasn't as sucessful as I would've hoped. I was left with three buttons on my screen most of the time. It was gonna be a "test your luck" game used with arrays, math.random & if/else statements. The player would have to click one of the three buttons and if you got 4 as your random number you'd lose & get jump scared. Although the concept was cool in theory, with the time I have wasted already & getting stuck for too long on making it work-I decided to restart..again...
      Even though I went through 2 failed attempts, I didn't give up, but I did decide to go a more simple route by choosing a quiz.
    I asked my sister what her favorite show was (Gravity Falls) and went on from there. I started with styling more first and setting the background. Seeing it slowly come together was very satifying. 

WHAT I LEARNED & IMPROVEMENTS :
    I learned a lot about myself developing wise. I noticed what my strengths / weaknesses were. My strength being planning, sketching thoughts & styling. My weaknesses being 
    time management / stubborness. I feel like I want things to go as planned so I stay stagnant for too long and lose track of my time. Next time I know to create more simple ideas from the start & go from there, also asking for more help. I get too in the zone and often forget I have resources all around me. I improved on my focus while coding, I really enjoyed creating something that I wanted to create / how I wanted to make it look. I feel even more invested & determined than before.

WHAT I WISHED TO HAVE OBTAINED :
   With my quiz a goal I wish I could've obtained makeing the Bill character on the side have some animation to him. Also having a timer and the Gravity Falls theme song playing in the back was a goal I wished I could have obtained. I really tried with the audio but ended up catching a virus on my computer instead which was no fun. But it was also kind of funny, I can only search via yahoo because of it. ( who even uses yahoo ?)
